# Introduction

```{r initial_setup, include = FALSE}
# load necessary packages (if you do not have them, you will need to install them first)
library(tidyverse) # for dataframe manipulation and plotting
library(magrittr) # for updating an object that is piped into a function (using `%<>%`)
library(here) # for finding the project folder
library(repurrrsive) # contains the star wars datasets
library(rlist) # for binding all lit elements by column (using `list.cbind`)
library(ggrepel) # for adding geom_text labels that do not overlap

# add gravitational constant (i.e., 6.67408 * 10^-11)
grav_constant <- 6.67408 * (10 ^ -11)

# load bespoke functions from the functions folder
source(here("functions/my_theme.R")) # load my_theme
source(here("functions/geom_saberhilt.R")) # load the function for creating the hilts of lightsabers
source(here("functions/geom_saberblade.R")) # load the function for creating the blades of lightsabers

# set figure output dimensions
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width  = 12, 
                      fig.height = 8)

# how to build this book
# 1. install the `bookdown` packages: install.packages("bookdown")
# 2. Navigate to the RStudio pane that has the environment in it. There should be the following tabs: (1) "Environment", (2) "History", (3) "Connection", (4) "Build", and (5) "Git". Select "Build" and click the button that says "Build Book"
```

Welcome! This portfolio shows the construction of three different visualizations 
of the Star Wars universe. The [first visualization][The People] shows the relationship between
average character age and gender. The [second visualization][The Starships] reveals how starship
classes differ in terms of length. The [third visualization][The Planets] shows the 
distance of Star War's planet from their host stars, with planets from our solar
system included for easy comparison.

All the data is from the `repurrrsive` package. The `repurrrsive` package includes 
various datasets to assist in the teaching of R. The Star Wars dataset is 
originally from [SWAPI](https://swapi.co) (e.g., the Star Wars API).
