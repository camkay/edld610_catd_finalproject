# Introduction

```{r index_initial_setup, include = FALSE}
# load necessary packages (if you do not have them, you will need to install them first)
library(tidyverse) # for dataframe manipulation and plotting
library(magrittr) # for updating an object that is piped into a function (using `%<>%`)
library(here) # for finding the project folder
library(repurrrsive) # contains the star wars datasets
library(rlist) # for binding all lit elements by column (using `list.cbind`)
library(ggrepel) # for adding geom_text labels that do not overlap
library(gganimate) # for animating the plot

# add gravitational constant (i.e., 6.67408 * 10^-11)
grav_constant <- 6.67408 * (10 ^ -11)

# load bespoke functions from the functions folder
source(here("functions/my_theme.R")) # load my_theme
source(here("functions/geom_saberhilt.R")) # load the function for creating the hilts of lightsabers
source(here("functions/geom_saberblade.R")) # load the function for creating the blades of lightsabers

# set figure output dimensions
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width  = 12, 
                      fig.height = 8)

# how to build this book
# 1. install the `bookdown` packages: install.packages("bookdown")
# 2. Navigate to the RStudio pane that has the environment in it. There should be the following tabs: (1) "Environment", (2) "History", (3) "Connection", (4) "Build", and (5) "Git". Select "Build" and click the button that says "Build Book"
```

Welcome! This portfolio shows the construction of three different visualizations 
of the Star Wars universe. The [first visualization][The People] shows the relationship between
average character age and gender. The [second visualization][The Starships] reveals how starship
classes differ in terms of length. The [third visualization][The Planets] shows the 
distance of Star War's planet from their host stars and animates their orbital periods. Planets from our solar
system are included for easy comparison.

All the data is from the `repurrrsive` package. The `repurrrsive` package includes 
various datasets to assist in the teaching of R. The Star Wars dataset is 
originally from [SWAPI](https://swapi.co) (e.g., the Star Wars API).
